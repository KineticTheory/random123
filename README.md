Random123
--------------------

* Random123 is a library of 'counter-based' random number generators (CBRNGs), in which the Nth  random number can be obtained by applying a stateless mixing function to N instead of the conventional approach of using  N iterations of a stateful transformation.

* This is a modified copy of [Deshaw Research's Random123](http://www.deshawresearch.com/resources_random123.html) [version 1.09](http://www.deshawresearch.com/downloads/download_random123.cgi/Random123-1.09.tar.gz).  Modifications were added to target ARM architectures.

* Random123 is a header-only release. To clone random123:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/KineticTheory/random123.git
```
